# PHP movie info

This is small CLI script that, given a list of movies from a txt file, generates a csv with general information about the movie, including the original title, director and the IMDB link. It uses the IMDB api to retrieve the information.

## Requirements

- PHP +5.6

## Usage

```sh
$ php movie-info.php movies.in > movies.csv
```
